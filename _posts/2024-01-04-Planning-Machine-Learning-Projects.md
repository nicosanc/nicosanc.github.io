## Introduction

With the growing frequency of the "AI" buzzword in most business sectors, it can be difficult to understand what these Machine Learning applications are actually accomplishing at each organization. Though the field may be at the height of its popularity, Machine Learning is not necessarily the golden ticket to infinite revenue for a company. There are many factors to consider even before the project cycle can be laid out. Most importantly, the organization must clarify what the direct impact of the ML integration will be and how much it will cost the company at large. These questions often times do not have obvious answers due to many ambiguities including availability of data and time needed to train and evaluate the model. Another major impact comes from the structure of the Machine Learning teams themselves and how their interactions with eachother and with management can affect the progress of a costly integration. 

## Defining The Goal

Before planning out which exciting supervised learning model you're going to use to ameliorate a current business problem, it is imperative to start by defining some key aspects of the journey. These can be laid out as a set of question such as the following.

**Will an ML product help make a difficult task in this project (or many projects) more manageable? Is there a clear benefit for producing predictions or clusters for this problem?**

**Are the performance requirements set by the interested parties feasible given the time, resource, and data constraints?**

**Does the focus on integrating predictive models align with the company's vision or goals for the future?**

**Is there a specific outcome that the organization has set? Is there a clear understanding by all parties of what the performance metrics are?**

**What is the availability of high quality and relevant data? How much will it cost to collect or generate this data?**
