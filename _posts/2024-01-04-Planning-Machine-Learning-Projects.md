## Introduction

With the growing frequency of the "AI" buzzword in most business sectors, it can be difficult to understand what these Machine Learning applications are actually accomplishing at each organization. Though the field may be at the height of its popularity, Machine Learning is not necessarily the golden ticket to infinite revenue for a company. There are many factors to consider even before the project cycle can be laid out. Most importantly, the organization must clarify what the direct impact of the ML integration will be and how much it will cost the company at large. These questions often times do not have obvious answers due to many ambiguities including availability of data and time needed to train and evaluate the model. Another major impact comes from the structure of the Machine Learning teams themselves and how their interactions with eachother and with management can affect the progress of a costly integration. 

## Defining The Goal

Before planning out which exciting supervised learning model you're going to use to ameliorate a current business problem, it is imperative to start by defining some key aspects of the journey. These can be laid out as a set of question such as the following.

**Will an ML product help make a difficult task in this project (or many projects) more manageable? Is there a clear benefit for producing predictions or clusters for this problem?**
Companies that are working on complex software will encounter tasks within their development phase that can be highly complex and exhausting for engineers. These factors, even after deployment is complete, will need to be maintained by those same engineers to ensure consistency in a project's performance. In a situation like this, it would make sense to invest the time into automating certain aspects of the task. This is especially useful when the rules of the task can be learned and when low cost, imperfect predictions speed up total productivity. 

**Are the performance requirements set by the interested parties feasible given the time, resource, and data constraints? Does the focus on integrating predictive models align with the company's vision or goals for the future?**
When multiple groups have stake in a project, like an organization's management and stakeholders, it is crucial for everyone to ensure the project's feasibility. This means consulting with the engineers and data scientists to get a perspective of the amount of time and compute needed to successfully tackle the issue. This can help non technical parties assess whether the integration fits in their time frame and whether the cost of implementation makes sense over that period of time. Companies may set unrealistic and overly ambitious goals that plan on revolutionizing the company just to compensate for the high costs of ML projects. This can lead to months or years of dedicated work to a project that may either fail in the end (costing millions) or wound up outdated given new discoveries. The idea is to set realistic goals that can be seen as a valuable investment of time rather than a necessity to rehaul the company. 

**Is there a specific outcome that the organization has set? Is there a clear understanding by all parties of what the performance metrics are?**

**What is the availability of high quality and relevant data? How much will it cost to collect or generate this data?**
