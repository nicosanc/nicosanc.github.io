**Asset Allocation**: How you deploy your overall capital, how you spread it out across different asset classes, such as shares, commodities and assets: 
- Diversification here can also be used to reduce risk
- Selecting an Asset Allocation strategy that suits your goals, risk tolerance, and length of time you want to hold an asset or collection of assets, should follow a structured plan. 

**Deposit Ratio**: The ratio of the two assets deposited is determined by the price you set up at this step

**Diversification**: A well known adage is "Never put all your eggs in one basket"
- Diversification refers to the practice of allocating capital across a broad range of fin asset classes, products, instruments, strats, and protocols
- Within DeFi, besides simply owning a range of assets, diversification can also refer to deploying those assets variously through - for example - staking, lending, or providing liquidity
- In the case of Concentrated Liqudity, it means to diversify within a single pool by selecting multiple price ranges

The goal of diversification is to reduce the overall risk that may arise from holding a narrow range of assets, asset classes, or deploying single strategies

**Divergence Loss**
One type of risk that LPs take in exchange for fees they earn in liquidity pools
If divergence loss exceeds the yield earned upon withdrawal, the user has suffered negative returns compared to holding their tokens outside the pool. 
In CLAMM pools, both the yield from trading fees and rewards, and divergence loss are amplified 

**Estimated Yield**
Projected yields are estimated using data drawn from the previous 25 hours of trading for the price range selected. Note that concentrating liquidity increases both yield and divergence loss, and previous returns are not a guarantee of future returns

**Fee Rate**
The percentage of each trade for this pool that goes to the LPs. This value may change to optimize fees over time

**In Range and Out of Range**
In a concentrated LP a user defines the boundaries of the price-range within which they wish to provide Liq
When the current price of the asset is within the selected price-range, a liquidity provider's position is In Range and the user will earn trade fees and any associated incentives
However, if the current price for the pair moves outside their position is then Out of Range and two things happen:
- Firstly, the users position will become dormant - no incentives, or trading fees, will be earned
- Secondly, the user's position will consist entirely of one asset.
- As long as the user's position remains Out of Range, these conditions will remain the case
-  If the current price for the pair moves back into the price-range of the user's position, then fees and rewards will recommence the balance of the position will once more begin to fluctuate with the relative values of the paired tokens

**Leverage** 
How concentrated your liquidity will be compared to a constant product AMM pool. If this number is 8x, you would earn 8x the fees and incentives for each trade, but you also allow for 8x losses

**NFT Mint Address**
The existence of price ranges makes each pool position unique. Therefore, each position is represented by an NFT instead of fungible pool tokens

**Price Range** 
Liquidity deposited will only be used for trades (and earn fees + incentives) when the current price of the assets in this pool is within this range

**Risk Tolerance** 
Describes the variability in expected terms (or losses) that a user is prepared to accept, across the planned time frame the user expects to hold the asset, when set against the assessed likelihood of possible outcomes
It is important that, as part of planning, users assess their personal willingness to accept the range of changes in value and incentives reasonably anticipated for their chosen assets / strats

**Tick spacing**
Each pool is divided evenly into buckets of liquidity with predefined boundaries known as "ticks"
A tick with spacing of 8 means that each tick is 0.08% larger than the previous tick, and 128 means that each tick is 1.28% larger than the previous tick
Stable pools use smaller ticks to allow for more granular price ranges
