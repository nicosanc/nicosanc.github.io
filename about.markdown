## Purpose
I am a recent graduate from the University of Michigan where I majored in Data Science and minored in Mathematics. In the months since finishing my undergraduate career, I have collected ample notes from topics in Machine Learning, Math, and Stats. I have begun to organize and rewrite my notes into blog posts to share my interesting findgings in a series of posts I am dubbing "What I've Learned". It is a mix of personal research, online tutorials, and online courses. 

## About Me
The personal journey I embarked on when I returned home from school has completely reshaped my perspective on reality and most importantly, the type of life I want to lead. I have spent my time reforging my personal identity to match what I've always aspired to be. This came from a combination of personal introspection and research on the mind and its intricasies. What I've come to realize is that our minds are mutable, designed by our thought patterns. The external world we experience becomes a mirror of our own inner dialogue and is thus completely in our control. This is because our behaviors and emotions are completely dictated by our thoughts. Therefore, I've shifted my thoughts to match those of the "Hero" I aspire to be. My thought patterns now follow these key principles: physical and mental discipline, gratitude for everything I have and will have, life long commitment to learning, and becoming so good at what I do that I cannot be ignored. This last principle is influenced from Cal Newport's Google Talk "So Good They Can't Ignore You" and Bill Gurley's talk "Runnin' Down A Dream". This trait is seen in every great person in every field of life. Those that commit themselves whole heartedly to what they do end up creating a life they can be passionate about. Thus, I am taking this idea and running with it. This blog will be one piece of this journey.
