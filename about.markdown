## Purpose
I am a graduate from the University of Michigan, where I majored in Data Science and minored in Mathematics. In the year since finishing my undergraduate career, I have collected ample notes from topics in Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Blockchain. I have begun to organize and rewrite my notes into blog posts to share my interesting findings in a series of posts dubbed "What I've Learned". It is a mix of personal research, online tutorials, and online courses. My most recent notes are blockchain related, specifically inspired by my completion of Starknet's Basecamp 9. I am dedicating my time to learning about Cryptography, Blockchain architecture, and dApp development. 

## About Me
The personal journey I embarked on when I returned home from school has completely reshaped my perspective on reality, and most importantly, the type of life I want to lead. I have grown an affinity for learning about learning. Specifically, how complex systems can make sense of data and use it to make optimal decisions. Reinforcement Learning became a major topic of interest as a consequence of this. Thus, I have embarked on a learning journey focused on absorbing as much information as I can, not only about Machine Learning but also about myself. This odyssey is influenced by Cal Newport's Google Talk "So Good They Can't Ignore You" and Bill Gurley's talk "Runnin' Down A Dream". This trait is a common denominator among all the "greats" across all fields. Those that commit themselves wholeheartedly to deeply learning about their realm of interest end up creating a life they can be passionate about. I am taking this idea and running with it.
